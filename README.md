# Master's Thesis in Finance 2025
This repository contains the materials for my Masterâ€™s thesis submitted to the University of Copenhagen in the summer of 2025. My thesis investigates stochastic dynamics in portfolio optimization with a particular focus on risk and return.

The repository includes two primary files:

- **NameX**: This Jupyter notebook estimates the risk aversion parameter \( \gamma \) using empirical market data. It applies various utility functions to analyze the impact of risk preferences on portfolio strategies.

- **NameY**: This Jupyter notebook simulates six portfolio optimization models under different market conditions. It provides numerical results for each model, focusing on optimal portfolio strategies and their associated risk-return profiles.
