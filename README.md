# Master's Thesis in Finance 2025
This repository contains the materials for my Master’s thesis submitted to the University of Copenhagen in the summer of 2025. My thesis investigates stochastic dynamics in portfolio optimization with a particular focus on the market price of risk.

The repository includes two primary files:

- **Chapter 8 - Estimating risk aversion**: This notebook estimates the CRRA risk aversion parameter using SPY return data from Yahoo Finance, based on a Markov-switching framework and a Taylor-expanded expected utility function.

- **Chapter 9 - Numerical results**: This notebook simulates results for six portfolio optimization models.
