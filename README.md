# Master's Thesis in Finance 2025
This repository contains the materials for my Masterâ€™s thesis submitted to the University of Copenhagen in the summer of 2025. My thesis investigates stochastic dynamics in portfolio optimization with a particular focus on the market price of risk.

The repository includes two primary files:

- **Chapter 8 - Estimating risk aversion**: This notebook estimates the risk aversion parameter using empirical market data from Yahoo Finance.

- **Chapter 9 - Numerical results**: This notebook simulates results for six portfolio optimization models.
