# Master's Thesis in Finance 2025
This repository contains the materials for my Master’s thesis submitted to the University of Copenhagen in the summer of 2025. My thesis investigates stochastic dynamics in portfolio optimization with a particular focus on the market price of risk.

The repository includes three primary notebooks:

- **Chapter 8 – Estimating Risk Aversion:**  
  Estimates the CRRA risk aversion parameter using SPY return data from Yahoo Finance, based on a Markov-switching framework and a Taylor-expanded expected utility function.

- **Chapter 9 – Numerical Results (CRRA and Habit):**  
  Simulates portfolio outcomes for four models: two based on standard CRRA preferences and two incorporating habit formation.

- **Chapter 9 – Numerical Results (Benchmark-Adjusted CRRA):**  
  Simulates two additional models based on benchmark-adjusted CRRA utility. Implemented separately due to conditional logic specific to this framework.
